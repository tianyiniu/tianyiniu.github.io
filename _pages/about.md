Hello! I am pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at [The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu). I am currently a Research Assistant at [MURGe-Lab](https://murgelab.cs.unc.edu), advised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). 

I previously graduated from UNC Chapel Hill highest distinction, obtaining a BS in Computer Science with highest honors and a BA in Linguistics. My undergraduate thesis (advised by [Prof. Shashank Srivastava](https://www.ssriva.com)) explored whether LLMs benefit from curriculum training on synthetic pre-training data.
